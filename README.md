# Z-Wave Protocol Implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B

For my Senior Design Project I took a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and implemented the Home Assistant. I read through a lot of research papers to understand how the Z-Wave Protocol works and what others have done with it so far.     
The files in here are for the Home Assistant, which implements various components and devices. The devices I implemented are two contact sensors for a window and door, a door lock, smart plug, and motion sensor. The Home Assistant sends notifications to my iPhone and also sends notifications to my email. I plan on implementing more items in the future and include more contact sensors for all my windows and include a couple cameras and motions sensors around my home for security.
